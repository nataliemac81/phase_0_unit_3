### Reflection
I wasn't too excited about this challenge honestly. It was really frustrating working through the sqlzoo site. I found the tutorials lacking because while I know the point was to research and not so much learn from the tutorials, I don't really see the point in that. There wasn't much guidance on the sqlzoo site in terms of figuring out the questions and giving any comprehensive information on the material. I just didn't feel like I learned anything. I used the w3schools website for reference but I was a bit hard since I didn't really know what I needed to look up at times.
