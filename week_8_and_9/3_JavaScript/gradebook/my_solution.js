/*
U3.W8-9: Gradebook from Names and Scores

You will work with the following two variables.  The first, students, holds the names of four students.  
The second, scores, holds groups of test scores.  The relative positions of elements within the two 
variables match (i.e., 'Joseph' is the first element in students; his scores are the first value in scores.).

Do not alter the students and scores code.

I worked on this challenge by myself

var students = ["Joseph", "Susan", "William", "Elizabeth"]

var scores = [ [80, 70, 70, 100],
               [85, 80, 90, 90],
               [75, 70, 80, 75],
               [100, 90, 95, 85] ]

// Write your code below.

// __________________________________________
// Refactored Solution
// As the initial solution seems pretty concise, I did not feel the need to refactor it.




// __________________________________________
// Reflect

//This was good practice. I still feel very rusty with Javascript and this challenge took a while to complete
//because I had to look up a lot of the concepts and syntax because I didn't exactly remember them. It's 
//crazy how much you forget after not using the language for a while.
